bio: |
  Kilian Kemgne is a PhD Student at IRIT, specializing in 
  memory and swap management. My research focuses on addressing 
  the double paging problem in runtimes, improving swap behavior, and optimizing overall system performance.

    summary: |
      Wworked on demonstrating that a memory allocator is equivalent to a scheduler. I implemented a system for transferring interrupts received by the scheduler into user space. I also studied scheduling techniques and ghOSt (SOSP ’21), developed by Google, which enables the definition of scheduling policies in user space.
